        <h1>Pomodoro Technique</h1>
        <p>
            The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
            The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato',
             after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
